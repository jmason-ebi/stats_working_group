# testDataset.R contains testDataset and modelFormula functions and constructs the PhenTestResult 
# class object

testDataset <- function(phenList, depVariable, equation="withWeight", outputMessages=TRUE, pThreshold=0.05, method="MM", keepList=NULL)
# Performs the following checks for dependent variable:
# 1. "depVariable" column should present in the dataset
# 2. "depVariable" should be numeric for Mixed Model (MM) framework, otherwise recommends Fisher Exact Test (FE)
# 3. Each one genotype level should have more than one "depVariable" level
# (variability) for MM framework, otherwise recommends FE framework. 

# Performs other consistency checks. For instance, when "depVariable" column contains cathegorical values, 
# but defined method is MM redefines method to FE.

# MM framework: 
# For MM framework creates start model and modifies it after testing of different hypothesis (the model effects).
# The model effects are: 
# - batch effect (random effect significance), 
# - variance effect (TRUE if residual variances for genotype groups are homogeneous and FALSE if they are heterogeneous), 
# - interaction effect (genotype by gender interaction significance), 
# - gender effect (gender significance), 
# - weigth effect (weigth significance).

# If user would like to assign other TRUE/FALSE values to the effects of the model 
# then he or she has to define keepList argument which is vector of TRUE/FALSE values.

# If user has defined model effects (keepList argument) then function prints out calculated and user defined effects 
# (only when outputMessages argument is set to TRUE), checks user defined effects for consistency 
# (for instance, if there are no "Weight" column in the dataset then weigth effect can't be assigned to TRUE, etc.)
# and modifies start model according to user defined effects. 

# As the result PhenTestResult object that contains calculated or user defined model effects and MM start model is created. 

# FE framework:  
# For Fisher Exact Test framework there are no special checks except "depVariable" checks mentioned above. 
# "buildFisherExactTest" function is called for count matrix (matrices) creation and Fihser tests performance. 

# As the result PhenTestResult object that contains Fisher tests output is created.
